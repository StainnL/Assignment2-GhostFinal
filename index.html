            <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
            <h4>Ghost is a metal rock band founded in 2006 within the country of Sweden, in the city of Linköping by the
                founder and lead singer; Tobias Forge. In the beginning roots of the band, they were (and still are)
                highly
                criticized for their satanic themes as well as controversial topics being discussed in their music. The
                first piece of music that they had released was a three track demo, which eventually led to their first
                album being released in 2010. Opus Eponymous, the name of the first album in question is what helped the
                band gain their grounding in their sound and lay the foundations for the future of the band. The themes
                within the band came from the lead singer and the fellow band member’s love for horror movies, and the
                inspiration for the theme being “Scandinavian Metal” themes such as intimidating face paint looks and a
                generally “scary” or “intimidating” appearance. Within the community that follows the band also comes
                the
                lingo with it, the lead singer goes through multiple eras where he plays different characters within a
                Ministry called “Papas” that each go by number all the way up to four as of currently. The other
                bandmates
                that play the instruments are known as “ghouls” which are also masked characters that are usually
                nameless
                unless named by fans of the band themselves. </h4>

            <h3>IMPORTANCE</h3>
            <h4>The inspiration behind Ghost that the lead singer wanted to push was that a lot of people are either
                held
                back by religious traditions or their family using religion as an excuse to strictly keep their children
                in
                line. The band’s message is that you should be your own person even through all the grime that sticks to
                you
                in life, that you shouldn’t let other people mold your perspective but build your own. Examples of the
                band’s messages in their work is to open the audience’s eyes to intimidation that some churches use to
                sway
                influence through the ages, as the band is highly critical of mainly Christianity and brings it into
                question. “You’ll be down on your knees and you’ll cry, cry for absolution.” I think that people now
                more
                than ever need to learn to just be themselves and not let things like religion, background, or
                ridiculous
                rules laid in culture of not being allowed to be gay, or transexual, or etc to be considered something
                hateful or mean. Due to these messages and youth from ages 16 to even people who are 30 that have a deep
                connection with this band like myself, the band has grown more this year than it ever has in it’s entire
                career. This growth is also due to the influence that TikTok has on youth, and how it has been used to
                spread their music, which became viral as a result. </h4>

            <h3>SYMBOLISM</h3>
            <h4>The symbolism shown in Ghost is a key element in the band itself, as previously mentioned, satanic
                imagery
                is a big part of how the band was founded. Different points of symbolism would be the use of the
                “Grucifix”
                which is the symbol that the band uses on a lot of merch and advertising. It is a mockup of a crucifix
                that
                is designed upside down, then filled with incredible detail and other symbols of “black magic” or
                demonology
                based shapes. The band uses this imagery in their music and music videos as well to make cryptic
                messages
                that the fans can participate in to create theories or generate ideas based on them. An example of this
                would be in one of the music videos where a woman is shown to be bleeding from her eyes after “Papa
                Emeritus
                IV” waves his hand over her eyes, the blood symbolizing the release of herself and her very being, sort
                of a
                twisted version of how Christian churches bless you of your sins so that you could keep going in your
                life.

            <h3>THE CONCERT</h3>
            <h4>As this entire website is supposed to be about something impactful in 2023, I want to talk about my own
                main
                experience I had with this band that absolutely changed my own perspective. I had gotten interested in
                the
                band at the beginning of 2023 and fell in love with it. I would have done anything to go to a concert, a
                live performance, anything of them if I could as they held great emotional attachment to me as I worked
                my
                way through my first year of university. My first year was very difficult as I had to deal with my
                biological parents who were heavily trying to rip me out of school and literally drag me out. However I
                pushed through school and my mental health at the help of this band’s music. Once it was announced in
                January/February that there would be a worldwide tour over the summer I was absolutely thrilled. That
                is,
                until I realized that there were no Canadian dates. So I made a quick decision and decided to plan and
                get
                tickets for a venue near San Francisco, in a town called Concord for their first performance in their
                tour.
                I struggled, as I had never flown anywhere in years let alone out of the country. I made friends that
                would
                meet me there so I had to fly all by myself. That concert showed me truly what friends are capable of
                and
                how you can find family in any environment, people gave me free stuff at the venue, the show was
                incredible
                and I cried seven times, the lead singer even pointed right at me and sang the special words “your
                beauty
                never ever scared me” to someone who never thought for a moment in their life that they were worth
                something. This band made me feel worth something. </h4>

            <h3>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <h4>Linking this concert back to my personal experiences and how it impacted me, I would say that since that
                concert I have mentally just been feeling better. To me, that performance was a reward for all of the
                hardships I went through that year. All of the tears, all of the pain, the struggle of getting an
                assignment
                done when you have to worry about the fact that your parents want to kidnap you literally just around
                the
                corner with a group of goons you don’t even know. When I was at that concert I could tell I wasn’t the
                only
                one, the people standing beside me, the many people behind me in that stadium, I could hear them crying
                through some of the songs, screaming out of joy or other intense emotions. The fans including myself
                considered the band like family even though we were never truly close to them in a personal sense. I
                made so
                many friends throughout my finding of this band, like friends that I would potentially have for life as
                I’ve
                never met better people. Since the band going viral and reaching the top charts of the metal genre after
                the
                song “Mary on a Cross” on TikTok, I was never more grateful for that happening as I never would have
                been
                fully introduced into the band without it. It helped me so much, especially since my own parents were
                incredibly abusive to the point that I had to change myself to what they wanted. Ghost made me realize
                that
                now that I have grown, I have learned that “this is the moment of just letting go.”</h4>

            <h3>FUN FACTS</h3>
            <h4>There’s a ton of fun facts to know! I thought I’d add a fun part to this last content based section of
                the
                website (besides citations I mean) so here are some facts about the band that I’d like to share so I
                encourage other people to check out the band for themselves if they are curious. Even if you don’t like
                metal music, they have a good range of content for you to check out instead, such as the Chapter videos
                which include lore within the fictional story of Ghost. The first one is that the very first iteration
                of
                Papa Emeritus was supposed to have two white eyes, only really seen in rare promotional videos, but that
                was
                decided against due to clashing creative choices. There were more videos supposed to come out of the
                songs
                within their first album, but due to the band still being fresh and not having a big following they had
                to
                cancel some of their music video plans due to money and time. These music videos were Elizabeth from
                album
                one, Opus Eponymus, and the other is Deus in Absentia, which is from their third album (my favorite)
                Meliora. Another fact is that many of their songs have been written at the same time, even entire albums
                as
                Tobias Forge tends to plan ahead a lot. So as a result, he had finished writing both Meliora and
                Prequelle
                but had to decide which one he would release first.</h4>
